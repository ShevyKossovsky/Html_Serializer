# Html Serializer Project (developed by S. kossovsky)

## Description

The Html Serializer project aims to develop a tool for handling and processing HTML content. This tool can be used for various purposes, such as implementing a web crawler.

A web crawler (or scrapper) is a mechanism that reads internet sites and analyzes their HTML to extract desired information. Essentially, this is exactly what Google's search engine (and others) does. The engine scans the internet and analyzes the HTML of all websites in order to index the information so it can retrieve it according to user search queries.

Additional examples of crawling use cases include:

- Analyzing internet sites to discover which technologies they are written in and which code libraries they use.
- Extracting data from shopping or second-hand websites to display on another site.
- And many more.

This project opens the foundational code that we can later use to develop our own crawler.

The tool developed in this project consists of two parts: Html Serializer and Html Query.

## Html Serializer

The Html Serializer module is responsible for serializing HTML content into a structured format. It parses HTML content and organizes it into an object-oriented structure, making it easier to manipulate and analyze.

## Html Query

The Html Query module enables querying and searching HTML content using selectors and criteria. It provides functions to find and extract specific elements or content from HTML documents based on predefined rules or patterns.

## Usage

To use the Html Serializer and Html Query modules, follow these steps:

1. Import the modules into your project.
2. Use the provided functions and methods to serialize HTML content and perform queries.
3. Handle the returned data as needed for your specific application, such as data analysis, web scraping, or content extraction.

## Installation

To install the Html Serializer project, simply download or clone the repository from the GitHub page and include the necessary files in your project directory.
